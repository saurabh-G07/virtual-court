Dear Developer,
Thank you for downloading the code from https://codehow2.com. Please read below points before using the code:

1) If you are using XAMPP, please create a folder under xampp/htdocs. Keep all extracted files and folders under that folder. For our example we created 'login' folder under xampp/htdocs. If you are using WAMP create the folder under wamp/www.

2) Create the table in your MySQL database . For our example we used test database. If you change the database name, just make sure to update database name in dbconnect.php

Feel free to post your queries, questions or your feedback under Comments section at the end of the topic in the website https://codehow2.com
